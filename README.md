## 🧠 Using the Prompts to Build VitaTrack

VitaTrack is designed to be **implemented using AI-generated prompt files**. These prompts contain all the detailed instructions required to build the platform — from infrastructure provisioning to frontend components.

### 📂 Prompt Directory Structure

Prompts are organized under `/prompts/` as follows:

prompts/
├── 01_Infrastructure & Setup (Tasks 1-10)/
├── 02_Backend Development (Tasks 11-35)/
├── 03_Frontend Development (Tasks 36-65)/
├── 04_AI & Smart Features (Tasks 66-75)/
├── 05_DevOps & Deployment (Tasks 76-85)/
└── 06_Testing & Documentation (Tasks 86-90)/



## 🛠️ How to Use the Prompts
- Start at Task 1: Go to the 01_Infrastructure & Setup folder
- Open each .json file: Read the instruction and context fully
- Follow in Order: Use the task_number to execute sequentially
- Implement & Verify:
    - Review architecture files in /Architecture/
    - Create/update files as per files_to_create
    - Respect tech stack constraints
    - Move to the next_tasks

### 💰 Business Model
- Freemium: Basic logging and tracking free
- Premium Plans: Unlock AI analytics, coaching, and integrations
- Ad Revenue: Healthy brand partnerships
- eCommerce: Meal kits, supplements, fitness gear

### 🔒 Security & Compliance
